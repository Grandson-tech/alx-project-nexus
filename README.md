## Project Nexus — ProDev Frontend Documentation Hub

### Repository: `alx-project-nexus`

I’m using this repository to capture my biggest takeaways from the ProDev Frontend Engineering program and to walk through a small case study: building a Movie Recommendation App. My goal is to keep this as a practical reference for myself and anyone following a similar path.

## Program Overview — ProDev Backend Engineering (for cross‑discipline context)

Alongside frontend work, I’ve paid attention to how the backend side is structured because it directly impacts the UX I can deliver. The ProDev Backend Engineering program emphasizes:
- API design (REST/GraphQL), authentication/authorization, and data modeling
- Service architecture (monoliths vs microservices), caching, and scalability
- Databases (SQL/NoSQL), migrations, and data integrity
- CI/CD, testing, observability, and production reliability

This matters for my frontend because reliable endpoints, clear contracts, and predictable error behavior translate into smoother UI states and fewer edge‑case bugs.

## Case Study — Developing a Movie Recommendation App (Web)

### Goals
- **Dynamic Routing**: Use Next.js to generate detailed movie pages and keep navigation snappy.
- **User Personalization**: Let users save favorite movies locally (and keep a clean path to an API later).
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Show trending and recommended movies in a responsive, lightweight grid.

### Technologies
- **Next.js (React)**: Routing, server rendering where useful, and prefetching
- **TypeScript**: Types for components, configs, and API responses
- **Styled Components**: Reusable, themeable styling with minimal global leakage
- **API Integration**: Public movie API (e.g., TMDB) with clear loading/error states

### Key Frontend Concepts Covered
- **Next.js**: File‑based + dynamic routing, sensible data‑fetching choices
- **TypeScript**: Typed props, safe API response models, narrow surface areas
- **System Design & Analysis**: Components that are easy to test and reuse
- **GraphQL/REST**: Picking the right transport and keeping responses predictable
- **API Integration**: Skeletons, retries (where appropriate), and graceful fallbacks
- **PWA (optional)**: Caching strategies and offline UX if/when needed

---

## Challenges & Solutions

1) **Unstable API responses (missing fields)**
- What I saw: some movies had missing `poster_path` or overview text.
- What I did: typed responses with optional fields, rendered placeholders, and added light schema checks to avoid crashing the UI.

2) **Performance on list views (scroll jank)**
- What I saw: large grids caused layout shifts and sluggish scroll.
- What I did: used image placeholders, memoized movie cards, and kept the DOM small via pagination/infinite scroll.

3) **Dynamic routing + fast navigation**
- What I saw: detail pages needed to feel instant and stay SEO‑friendly.
- What I did: Next.js dynamic routes with prefetching; set up meta tags and structured data on detail pages.

4) **Favorites persistence**
- What I saw: simple persistence without introducing a backend.
- What I did: a small `localStorage` utility with a versioned schema and SSR guards; left a clear path to swap in API storage later.

5) **Environment variable management**
- What I saw: risk of leaking API keys in the client bundle.
- What I did: kept secrets server‑side (proxy/API route), documented `.env.local`, and avoided exposing sensitive values to the browser.

## Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

- **Type boundaries, not everything**: I focus types where they pay off the most—API responses and component inputs.
- **Design for failure**: Loading states and helpful errors save time during development and make the app feel reliable.
- **Keep components pure**: Move fetching and side effects outward so components are easy to test and reuse.
- **Performance first**: Optimize images, reduce re‑renders, and prefetch routes that users are likely to visit.
- **Version your data**: Even with `localStorage`, a tiny schema + version helps when you change shapes later.

## Collaboration

- **Frontend peers**: We compared component patterns, refined TypeScript types, and aligned on tokens.
- **Backend peers**: We discussed pagination/filtering, error contracts, and rate‑limit headers to keep the UI responsive.
- **Where**: `#ProDevProjectNexus` on Discord for Q&A, pairing, and updates.

## Suggested Repository Structure

```
alx-project-nexus/
  README.md
  docs/
    movie-app-case-study.md   # (optional) deeper dives, screenshots, flows
```

This repository is documentation‑focused. If I publish code, I’ll link to a separate app repository from here.

---

## Markdown Conventions

- Use clear headings, lists, and short code snippets where helpful.
- Diagrams or screenshots (in `docs/`) make flows and states easier to skim.
